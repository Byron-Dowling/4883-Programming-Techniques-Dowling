##### Problem Description:
Given a range [a, b], you are to find the summation of all the odd integers in this range. For example, the summation of all the odd integers in the range [3, 9] is 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24.

##### Input
There can be at multiple test cases. The first line of input gives you the number of test cases, T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100). Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of 2 integers a and b (0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 100) in two separate lines.

##### Output
For each test case you are to print one line of output – the serial number of the test case followed by the summation of the odd integers in the range [a, b].

##### Sample Output
Case 1: 9\
Case 2: 8
