#### Problem Description:
Dynamic Programming utilizing Kadanes Algorithm.

#### Approach/Comments:
I had a n^3 Kadanes solution working for many uDebug files but was getting stuck on a few edge cases where each column was negative and as you traversed from left to right the numbers got closer to zero. This seemed to break my solution and I was struggling to find a way around it. I eventually just scrapped it and went with a n^4 solution after seeing that Dr. Griffin had one accepted in respectable time.
