A sequence of n > 0 integers is called a jolly jumper if the absolute values of the difference between
successive elements take on all the values 1 through n âˆ’ 1. For instance,
1 4 2 3
is a jolly jumper, because the absolutes differences are 3, 2, and 1 respectively. The definition implies
that any sequence of a single integer is a jolly jumper. You are to write a program to determine whether
or not each of a number of sequences is a jolly jumper.
