##### Problem Description:
Your little brother has just learnt to write one, two and three, in English. He has written a lot of those words in a paper, your task is to recognize them. Note that your little brother is only a child, so he may make small mistakes: for each word, there might be at most one wrong letter. The word length is always correct. It is guaranteed that each letter he wrote is in lower-case, and each word he wrote has a unique interpretation.

##### Input
The first line contains the number of words that your little brother has written. Each of the following lines contains a single word with all letters in lower-case. The words satisfy the constraints above: at most one letter might be wrong, but the word length is always correct. There will be at most 10 words in the input.

##### Output
For each test case, print the numerical value of the word.
