These are the words chanted by some two million people from world heading, as if pulled by a magnet, to one single spot on Earth. As has happened every year for 14 centuries, Muslim pilgrims gather in Makkah to perform rituals based on those conducted by the Prophet Muhammad during his last visit to the city. Performing these rituals, known as the Hajj, is the fifth pillar of Islam and the most significant manifestation of Islamic faith and unity. Undertaking the Hajj at least once is a duty for Muslims who are physically and financially able to make the journey to Makkah. The emphasis on financial ability is meant to ensure that a Muslim takes care of his family first. The requirement that a Muslim be healthy and physically capable of undertaking the pilgrimage is intended to exempt those who cannot endure the rigors of extended travel. The pilgrimage is the religious high point of a Muslim’s life and an event that every Muslim dreams of undertaking. Umrah, the lesser pilgrimage, can be undertaken at any time of the year; Hajj, however, is performed during a five-day period from the ninth through the thirteenth of Dhu Al-Hijjah, the twelfth month of the Muslim lunar calendar. It is generally presumed that the Hajj performed on Friday is called ‘Hajj-e-Akbar’ and it is a superior kind of Hajj as compared with the Hajj performed on other days of the week. But, the correct meaning of the term, as explained by a large number of the commentators of the Holy Quran is that the Umrah, which can be performed at any time throughout the year, was generally called ‘Hajj-e-Asghar’ (the minor Hajj). In order to distinguish hajj from Umrah the former was named ‘Hajj-e-Akbar’ (the greater hajj). Therefore, each and every hajj is Hajj-e-Akbar, no matter whether it is performed on Friday or on any other day. The word ‘Akbar’ (greater) is used only to distinguish it from Umrah which is a minor Hajj.
