This assignment was fairly straightforward. Initially I attempted reading the numbers into a file and then using a while loop to read to the end of the file and perform the arithmetic on the numbers. However this solution exceeded the time limit. My solution that was accepted simply built upon the provided method of reading in the values and thne performing the arithmetic on them and cout-ing the result before reading in the next values.

An even quicker version would likely utilize bitwise operations but would likely use an Exclusive OR and bit-flipping.
